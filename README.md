Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Sentiment Analysis model built to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. It was created using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, and it focuses on assessing the effectiveness of various classification metrics.

Overview


The objective of this model is to analyze and classify the sentiment in movie reviews. By using a labeled dataset of reviews, the model learns to identify patterns associated with positive and negative sentiments. This is especially useful for understanding customer feedback and improving user experience.

Dataset


The dataset used for this project consists of movie reviews, labeled as either positive or negative. It was preprocessed to remove any irrelevant elements, such as punctuation and stop words, to make the text easier for the model to analyze.

Model


The model was built using Python and various machine learning libraries. Techniques like text vectorization (using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings) and feature extraction were applied to convert the text data into a format suitable for training.

Steps Involved:


Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying tokenization.
Text Vectorization: Transformed text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
Model Training: Trained the model using various machine learning classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Requirements

Python 3.x
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
nltk (for NLP preprocessing)
matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


To install the required libraries, you can use:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/michaelnkema1/sentiment-analysis-model.git

Preprocess the data and run the model:


python sentiment_analysis.py
Evaluation

The model’s performance was measured using various classification metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified reviews.
Precision: Indicates the proportion of positive predictions that were actually positive.
Recall: Measures the model's ability to identify all positive samples.
F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.
These metrics were essential to assess the effectiveness of the model, particularly in a real-world scenario where the balance between precision and recall is important.

Results

The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy score, making it effective at classifying sentiments in movie reviews. The classification metrics provided further insights into the model’s precision and recall balance.
